    "Using [escher-FBA](https://sbrg.github.io/escher-fba), maximize for the aerobic production of a triglyceride (glyc_3octa_c) from glycine (gly_c) as the sole substrate (setting the lower bound of glycine uptake to -1)\n",

    "2. Include a screenshot of the computed solution with your homework submission\n",
    "3. When observing the optimal solution on the escher map, it is clear that many biochemical processes are requried to facillitate the conversion of glycine to a triglyceride. Provide a brief interpretation of the optimal solution. For example:\n",
    "  - Why is the urea cycle active? it is\n",
    "  - Glycine is metabolized to serine with the use of a 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate cofactor. What is the role of this cofactor and how is it replenished in the solution?\n",
    "  - Why is flux diverted into the mitochondria if both the substrate and product are cytosolic metabolites?\n",

    "2. the screenshot is included at the bottom of this file\n",
    "3. Questions \n",
    "  - Why is the urea cycle active? Urea cycle is active according to the simulated results. It makes sense because triglyceride synthesis and cleavage produces additional NH4. These produced NH4 is then used in urea cycle.\n",
    "  - Glycine is metabolized to serine with the use of a 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate cofactor. What is the role of this cofactor and how is it replenished in the solution? 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate cofactors is the methyl donor of the reaction. It is replenished by glycine cleavage system, likely a balance between mitochondria/cytosol 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate cofactor.\n",
    "  - Why is flux diverted into the mitochondria if both the substrate and product are cytosolic metabolites? mitochondria is the power house of the cell and produces energy for the reactions.\n",
    "  - What is the role of the citrate malate shuttle? It provides Acetyl-CoA to the synthesis pathway, which essentially provides acetate\n",
    "  - Why is the pentose phosphate pathway active? This pathway generates the major reducing agent for other pathways in the cell (e.g. NADPH)"

When the rate of use of ATP is relatively low, the rate of electron transfer is low; when demand for ATP increases, electron-transfer rate increases. Under these conditions of tight coupling, the number of ATP molecules produced per atom of oxygen consumed when NADH is the electron donor—the P/O ratio—is about 2.5.\n",
